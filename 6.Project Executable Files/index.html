  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Liver diseases avert the normal function of the liver. Mainly due to the large amount of alcohol consumption, liver disease arises. Early prediction of liver disease using classification algorithms is an efficacious task that can help the doctors to diagnose the disease within a short duration of time. Discovering the existence of liver disease at an early stage is a complex task for the doctors. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the parameters of various classification algorithms and compare their predictive accuracies to find the best classifier for determining liver disease. This paper focuses on the related works of various authors on liver disease such that algorithms were implemented using Weka tool that is a machine learning software written in Java. Various attributes that are essential in the prediction of liver disease were examined and the dataset of liver patients was also evaluated. This paper compares various classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression</p>
